Be sure to call in the file and with each function you can do the following!
- arr_malloc = malloc for the array.
- arr_make = populates the array, once malloc'd.
- find_minimum = locates the smallest number in an array.
- min_amount = finds the amount of occurences of a minimum.
- find_and_delete_minimum = locates each minimum and then deletes it.
